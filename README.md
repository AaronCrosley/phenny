phenny
======

This is an experimental port of phenny, a Python IRC bot, to Python3. Do not
expect it to work well or at all yet.

Support for IPv6 has been added, and SSL support is in the works.

Compatibility with existing phenny modules has been mostly retained, but they
will need to be updated to run on Python3 if they do not already.

Installation
------------

1. Run `./phenny` - this creates a default config file
2. Edit `~/.phenny/default.py`
3. Run `./phenny` - this now runs phenny with your settings

Enjoy!
